- This app is based on a trial period post which you're supposed to subscribe / get lifetime membership to continue using the app.
- You can try Fdroid version (all features except Face analysis capabilities) for a FLOSS version.
- Fdroid version may list app as anti-feature: don't worry we're not using third party network service, our app calls our own servers just to validate your trial using a random ID that is generated by our own app.
